'''Explorer's Dilemna - aka the Knapsack Problem
After spending several days exploring a deserted island out in the Pacific, 
you stumble upon a cave full of pirate loot! There are coins, jewels, 
paintings, and many other types of valuable objects.
However, as you begin to explore the cave and take stock of what you've 
found, you hear something. Turning to look, the cave has started to flood! 
You'll need to get to higher ground ASAP. 
There IS enough time for you to fill your backpack with some of the items 
in the cave. Given that...
- you have 60 seconds until the cave is underwater
- your backpack can hold up to 50 pounds
- you want to maximize the value of the items you retrieve (since you can 
only make one trip)
HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHICH ITEMS TO TAKE?
